- 👋 Hi, I’m @rundmsteve
- 👀 I’m interested in home labbing and self-hosting services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, polishing my linux terminal skills, managing my docker containers on portainer, and having a lot of fun with iot devices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on containerizing new apps in docker.
